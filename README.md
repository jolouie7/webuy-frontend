> Installations will be for both frontend and backend

### Backend Installation
Make a new directory, then change into that directory. Within that directory:

Clone the project on your local machine
```bash
git clone git@github.com:jolouie7/webuy-backend.git
```
Change into the webuy-backend directory
```bash
cd webuy-backend
```
Install dependencies by using [bundler](https://bundler.io/guides/rails.html)
```bash
bundle install
```
We will be using postgres as our database for this project. If you haven't please install it, [postgres](https://postgresapp.com/)
- After you finish installing postgres make sure you have it running before proceeding

Create your database, migrate, and seed the data for the database. The seed data will be generated by [faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker)
```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```
Start your rails server
```bash
rails s
```
